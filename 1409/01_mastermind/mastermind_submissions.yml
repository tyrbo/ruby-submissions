    notes: "Shows strong effort toward organization. Some closely-coupled objects.
            Good use of best-choice enumerables (collect, any? zip).
            Well-tested in isolation and integration.
            Integrated difficulty level in REPL. Clear to use.
            Saw intent to break apart logical components, but some objects tied together that will make future iterations or changes difficult to implement."

    notes: "Don't kill me...
            Complex code with long methods, but saw logic ____.
            Saw map and include?; used .each for generating color sequence (look into better choice enumerable).
            Small, encapsulated classes had solid tests, but game_manager was difficult because of too much going on.
            Game was pleasant to play, but did not always behave as expected.
            Pulled out input, printer, color sequence, and guess checker into small, manageable classes; would like to see game manager separated into objects that perform certain responsibilities.

    notes: "Showed effort toward good organization and refactoring.
            Saw use of each_with_index, map, count for enumerables.
            Small classes well-tested, but missing tests for game logic.
            Some rough edges in game play (not major features), but clear and pleasant to play otherwise.
            Broke out responsibilities into small classes (timer, code generator, message printer, etc.), but game class could be smaller."

    repository: https://github.com/gregnar/mastermind.git
    notes: "Saw good naming conventions; some long methods with nested loops/case/until statements.
            Saw map, each_with_index, count; check use of destructive .map! and chaining each_with_index and count together.
            Good use of StringIO for testing input/output. Well-tested in isolation and integration.
            Game is easy and pleasant to use; implemented turns and difficulty options.
            Encapsulated responsibilities into separate objects (printer, checker, cli, game, sequence generator, color sequence), but would like to see less logic per method (especially with loops and case statements)."

    notes: "Good naming conventions; shows effort toward organization and refactoring.
            Saw each_with_index and count -- and chained together! :)
            Well-tested with guess checker, but missing tests on game, board, and printer.
            Couldn't find edge-cases to break REPL. Pleasant to use.
            Able to pull board and game apart easily; would like to see case statements pulled out from within methods."

    notes: "and that's that.
            Some methods clean and single-responsibility; others need refactoring.
            Saw use of each to iterate. Would like to see enumerables used in place of stacked if statements.
            Attempt at testing to get user input but not implemented.
            REPL easy to use; clear and easy to play.
            Broke apart printer, CLI, and game (run), but Run class included a lot of responsibilities.

    notes: "Game plays well. Decent job of testing (w/ 17 tests). Many good
            unit tests, need some tests at a higher level that imitate the user.
            Ruby uses small methods, simple code, solid Ruby API. Pull some
            responsibilities like sequence generation out into their own classes."

    notes: "Definitely shows a growing grasp of OO concepts and idiomatic Ruby.
            had some long and methods that did multiple things.
            Also had a few classes that had to reach a bit too deeply to keep the game logic together."
