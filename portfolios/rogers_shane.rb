Challenging aspects overcome in this project included the substitution of a traditional ActiveRecord based relational database to using a node based graph database called Neo4j. As well as this I learned Cypher the query language for Neo4j, implemented the VivaGraph JS graphing library to visualize the node relationships and constructed trenched background workers that mitigate Twitter rate limiting issues.",
