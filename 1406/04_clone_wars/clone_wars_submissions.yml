      notes: 'Would have been nice to see unit tests.
              DatabaseRepository seems to know a lot. Maybe it would have been better to extract functionality out to the model it belongs to.
              There is a ton of inline CSS and JavaScript that we feel could have been pulled out into separate css/js files.'
